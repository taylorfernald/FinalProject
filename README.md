https://www.python.org/downloads/

Latest pygame release:

Running instructions:
This command runs the game: python3 -m src.main

Controls: 
In the lobby, click the Server or Client button and have a friend click the other on their version of the game. Once the connection is established, the game begins.
In the game, on your turn you can do the following:
  * Build a settlement on unoccupied land that is also adjacent to another settlement (ownership is irrelevant).
  * Fight a settlement to destroy it.
Establish a number of turns beforehand. Whoever owns the most settlements at the end of that turn limit wins.
