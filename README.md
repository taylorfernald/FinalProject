 Install instructions:

 Make sure you have python3, pygame and socket.

 Installing Python3:
 https://www.python.org/downloads/

 Latest pygame release:
 python3 -m pip install -U pygame==2.6.0

 Running instructions:
 This command runs the game: python3 -m src.main

 Controls: 
 In the lobby, click the Server or Client button and have a friend click the other on their version of the game. Once the connection is established, the game begins.
 In the game, on your turn you can do the following:
   * Build a settlement on unoccupied land that is also adjacent to another settlement (ownership is irrelevant).
   * Fight a settlement to destroy it.
Establish a number of turns beforehand. Whoever owns the most settlements at the end of that turn limit wins.
